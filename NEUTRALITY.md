# HJS Infrastructure Neutrality Declaration

**Version 1.0 | February 18, 2026**

HJS is a **structural layer infrastructure**, not a responsibility court. This declaration aims to define our boundaries and prevent the project from sliding into roles it should not assume.

---

## I. Core Positioning

> **HJS records structure. It does not judge outcomes.**

The HJS protocol does one thing: **records structured traceable events**. It does not define, determine, or guarantee any external responsibility.

---

## II. What We Do NOT Do

### ❌ Do NOT Determine Legal or Moral Responsibility
- We do not answer "who is responsible"
- We do not provide "responsibility scores"
- We do not identify "wrongdoers"

### ❌ Do NOT Evaluate Decision Correctness
- We do not judge whether decisions are fair, reasonable, or compliant
- We do not label decisions as "good" or "bad"

### ❌ Do NOT Make Governance Decisions for Users
- We do not mandate data retention periods
- We do not enforce specific technologies
- We do not require particular anchoring strategies

### ❌ Do NOT Provide Compliance Guarantees
- We do not guarantee that records meet any jurisdiction's compliance requirements
- We do not assume legal responsibility arising from users' use of this protocol

---

## III. What We Do

### ✅ Record Structure
- Record "who" (entity)
- Record "what action" (action)
- Record "in what context" (scope)
- Record "when" (timestamp)

### ✅ Provide Traceability Interfaces
- Each record may optionally include an immutability anchor (e.g., OTS)
- Anchor type is chosen by the user, we do not enforce
- Proof files can be independently verified

### ✅ Maintain Interface Neutrality
- API exposes only structural capabilities
- Field names are neutral (e.g., `entity` instead of `responsible_party`)
- Documentation clearly defines boundaries

---

## IV. Expectations for Implementers

If you build implementations based on the HJS protocol, we expect you to:

1. **Do not tamper with the record structure** (maintain traceability)
2. **Do not imply the protocol can determine responsibility** (define boundaries in your own documentation)
3. **Respect user choice** (do not enforce anchor types)
4. **Comply with the open source license** (AGPL-3.0)

---

## V. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances shall the HJS Foundation, its contributors, or affiliated parties be liable for:

- Legal disputes arising from data recorded using this protocol
- User misinterpretation of record contents
- Loss of evidence due to anchoring technology failure (e.g., OTS service interruption)
- Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages
